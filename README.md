# skosmos-config

## custom views

The custom views are copied from the Skosmos repository and edited to adjust the content to Digdirs context.
The views overwrites the Skosmos views on the COPY step in the Dockerfile.
They must manually be updated on changes in the upstream source files from Skosmos.
